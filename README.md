## User Flow

* The user lands on the splash at the root page
* The user presses the start button and the instructions appear on the page 
* The map renders and the user can move through the maze and find the exit
* There is a timer that counts down the amount of time that the user has before the game is over
* When the timer runs out or the user finds the exit, there will we a victory/death screen displayed to the user
* The victory/loss screen has a replay button


## MVP

* There is an info screen letting the user know how to play the game
* Starting the game renders a 3D maze
* The user can navigate the 3d maze in first person view
* The user can win by finding the exit
* The user loses when the time runs out

### Stretch Goals

* Add sfx
* Add traps
* Time bonuses
* Add monsters
* Add monsters patrol patterns
* Add a battle system
* Add a database
* Go full stack and add a leaderboard

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Process by Day breakdown

* Day 1 - 2 learn Three.js and React 3 Fibre through the React 3 fibre portfolio building tutorial and #D game building tutorials
* Day 2 - 3 build and renders maze
* Day 3 - 4 figure out how to implement movement through the maze
* Day 4 - 6 buffer days to get the maze to render and the user to move through the maze
** If there are no issues here we we start building out the start game and instruction screens
** Add the timer and the win and lose conditions
** If there is time we will work on the stretch goals in order

## Potential Road Blocks

* Learning this library may not be strait forward
